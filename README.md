My own implementations of common cryptographic algorithms from scratch. With integrating them into a simple website that allows users to input plain text, choose an algorithm, and then obtain the encrypted text. Alternatively, users can input encrypted text, choose an algorithm, and then obtain the decrypted plain text.
